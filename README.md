# Monochrome Magic: Convert Colorful Images to Black and White
This repository contains a C program designed to convert color images in the BMP format to black and white. The program takes a .bmp file as input, processes it, and generates a new black and white version of the image.

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/raresc4/monochrome-magic.git

Compile the C program using a C compiler such as GCC:
gcc monochrome.c -o monochrome

Run the program by providing the path to the input BMP file and to the output file as a command-line argument:
./monochrome input_image.bmp output_image.bmp

The program will generate a new BMP file named output_image.bmp in the same directory, containing the black and white version of the input image.
